  <h2 style="color: rgb(89, 105, 248);">My first week at AkiraChix</h2>  
  <p>When i first stepped into AkiraChix i was excited and nervous at the same time. The atmosphere was welcoming and it was so easy to make new friends
    which helped me to ease my anxiety. However the curriculum seemed to be a bit advanced more than i expected, but my trainers were more supportive and 
helped me to overcome my challenges. in short my experience at AkiraChix is one of a kind teaching me to be resilient and adaptive in order to be a woman of my dreams. </p>
